If your domain is sarthak.com and you're deploying your Spring Cloud Gateway and services (like payment-service) to a cloud environment, you can set up routing and domain management effectively. Here's how you can do that:

Example Setup for Domain sarthak.com
Deploy the Gateway:

First, deploy your Spring Cloud Gateway application to your cloud environment (e.g., Cloud Foundry, AWS, etc.).
Once deployed, you would typically assign a subdomain or a route for the Gateway. For example, you might have:
Gateway URL: https://gateway.sarthak.com
Domain Configuration for Services:

Each of your services (like payment-service, order-service, etc.) should also be deployed to the cloud environment. They should be configured to register with the Eureka server.
You might have routes for these services like:
Payment Service URL: https://payment.sarthak.com
Eureka Server Configuration:

Your Eureka server will also need to be deployed and accessible. You might have:
Eureka Server URL: https://eureka.sarthak.com
Configure each service and the Gateway to point to this Eureka server in their application.yml files:
Gateway Configuration (application.yml):
yaml
Copy code
spring:
  cloud:
    gateway:
      routes:
        - id: payment-service
          uri: lb://payment-service  # Load-balanced URI for service discovery
          predicates:
            - Path=/payment/**
  eureka:
    client:
      service-url:
        defaultZone: https://eureka.sarthak.com/eureka/
Payment Service Configuration (application.yml):
yaml
Copy code
spring:
  application:
    name: payment-service  # Name of the service for Eureka
  eureka:
    client:
      service-url:
        defaultZone: https://eureka.sarthak.com/eureka/
DNS Configuration:
Ensure that your DNS provider is set up to point the domains/subdomains to the correct IP addresses of your deployed applications.
This means configuring A records or CNAME records for gateway.sarthak.com, payment.sarthak.com, and eureka.sarthak.com to point to your cloud instances.
Summary
Subdomain Routing: Each service can have its own subdomain (e.g., payment.sarthak.com), or you can route everything through the Gateway at gateway.sarthak.com.
Eureka Integration: Ensure that all services are registered with Eureka for discovery, and the Gateway uses lb:// to route to those services.
DNS Management: Properly manage your DNS records to direct traffic to the correct services.
This setup will help you manage routing and service discovery effectively within your domain sarthak.com. If you have specific use cases or configurations in mind, feel free to share them!
